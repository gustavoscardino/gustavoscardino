# Personal and academic projects

In this section, I highlight the projects in which I had practical experience in the tools I intend to use in my career and systems that development required the application 
of engineering methods learned during my undergraduate.

Firstly, here is a list of some small projects I developed or helped to develop:

- [Energy View](https://github.com/EnergyView/EnergyView-FrontEnd) : Dashboard for monitoring real-time energy consumption
- [Piece Pilot](https://github.com/gabrielpalassi/PiecePilot) : Web Application of a e-commerce
- [Chess Game](https://github.com/gustavoscardino/ChessGame): A Chess Game Application written in C#
- [Just Coding !](https://github.com/gustavoscardino/just-coding) :  Repository dedicated to study and research new programming languages and techniques
